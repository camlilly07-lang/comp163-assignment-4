# comp163-assignment-4

My code starts off with fixed stats of myself and its up to the decision of whoever uses my code to see the different outcomes of my college life.

Your stats:
Social points
Stress levels
GPA

The code begins with an output of three different courseload options. 
A) Light (12 credits)
B) standard (15 credits)
C) Heavy (18 credits)

I used if, elif, and else statments so that if a condition is true my stats are changed based on the level of courseload as the light courseload results in less stress and a higher gpa. Standard courseload will give you a decrease in gpa as you're taking on more classes. And Heavy courseload will result in the lowest gpa as that's the maximum amount of credits you can take in a semester.

Now the user has to make another decision based on four study options and an if statement is used to see if the user's decision is in the list of study options, if it's not it will output that you have decided to skip studying and instead went to party. This will hurt your gpa but increase your social points and will decrease your overall stress. the else option will just output "Invalid choice". After the if/elif/else statements are finished the code will output your gpa, social points, and stress levels

The code has defined the variables chancellors list and Dean's list which will check the value of your gpa  in an if conditional with gpa >= 3.75 which is the value of the chancellor list and will also have a nested if statements to also check the value of social points and stress levels and will output different outcomes based on which conditional in the nested if statments are true.

Identity operators is used in the code and it checks the stress level and checks if stress level is equal to stress limit which is 55. If the identity operator is true the output will print that you've reached stress burnout
and with the else statement it will output that you've managed to avoid reaching burnout.

At the end of the program it will output your final stats after every decision has been made ending the code.
